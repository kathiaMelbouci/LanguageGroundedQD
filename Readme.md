## Dependencies 

### Toy environment dependencies

1. Libfastsim 
2. pyfastsim
3. gym_fastsim

### Dataset annotation dependencies

OpenAI API key and procedure, etc.

## Using the pretrained models

## Training the model 

This can be done with the existing datasets that are under `blabla`. Otherwise see next section on generating your own dataset.

## Generating datasets 

1. generate archive and annotate it with semantic info
2. use the prompting script together with your openAI api key to generate variable descriptions.

Use the resulting archive to train the model as specified above.
