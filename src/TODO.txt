3. Add a script that load that archive and then annotates it with semantic info (you might need to do a bit of manual defining here)
   3.1 I've added the new environment with bounding boxes and vector images (under creative commons) + added the color tiling
       - I need to add an image tiling to the Scene and check on which tile the points fall
       - NavigationEnv needs to have one of those Scence objects, and use it to annotate trajectories.
       - I think that the annotation here needs to be coarser, i.e. it shouldn't be made on all timesteps. Maybe just keep the timesteps at which we reach a point with new semantic info, for
         example: (timestep_15: "north of fridge", timestep_21: "", timestep_32: "south_west_of_bathtub", timestep_33: "west of bathtub", ....)
       - I think you can map trajectories to manual descriptions: e.g. you can say the traj goes up from the initial point x if it never goes down there, but yeah, that might be ambiguous...
4. Add the lllm prompting part to generate descriptions for each of the trajectories
5. Verify dataset

Now... The transformer part
