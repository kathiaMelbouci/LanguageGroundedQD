def generate_description_request(traj_info:dict):

        prompt="""Let us consider a square of size 200x200. The origin is fixed at the bottom left corner, and the x,y axes are respectively horizontal and vertical (with x looking towards
        the right, i.e. east, and y looking upwards, i.e. north). Let us define a python dictionary to represent point that have been sampled from a 2d trajectory in that square. 
        The dictionary will have the following keys: dict_keys(['timestep', 'pos', 'semantics', 'colors']). Here is the explanation for each: 1) The complete trajectories are
        composed of N points, and each has a timestep t_i (with i ranging from 0 to N-1).  The 'timestep' key corresponds to the t_i of the sampled point. 2) the 'pos' key is for
        the 2d position of the point, expressed as (x,y) in the coordinate frame defined above. 3) The square actually represents a room, where there are several objects. 
        The 'semantics' gives information about objects to which the points are close (name of objects, and agent position w.r.t those, e.g. to the east of the cactus. Note that east,
        west, north, south directions are relative to objects, not relative to the agent. Also, east=right, west=left, north=up, south=down). 4) The room which is represented
        by the 200x200 square also has tiles of different colors in different areas. The 'colors' key gives information about the tile 
        color where the 2d point is. Your task is to ask an algorithm to generate an agent capable of going throught the given trajectory. An example of such a request could be 'Can you make a
        policy that is able to go near the A, then to the east of the B, before goint to C and then stoping near D?', where A, B, C, D are extractred from the python dictionary described above (you
        should never use those letters without replacing them with relevant info from the dict).
        Another example coule be 'Hi! My name is <insert_human_name_here>! I want you to make a network that can go from the fridge to A?' or 'Can you generate a trajectroy from A to B that 
        goes through C?'. Any combination of objects and tile colors is acceptable in your request as long as it matches the trajectory described in the python dict. You can also arbitrarily
        replace the last position/object/tile at the end of the trajectory with '<DESCRIPTOR>' if you want.
        NOTE: you must NEVER mention the python dictionary in the description. For example, 'Can you generate a policy that is able to follow the trajectory described in the given python
        dictionary?' is unacceptable. 
        Please do NOT use any numerical values such as coordinates, and do NOT use timestep values, at all. The trajectory will be given after the tag [TRAJECTORY], and I want you to write
        your request after [REQ]."""
